# idur
a community package manager to debian systems (ubuntu-based too)

Like an AUR, but more simple.

## Easy to use
```
sudo idur install <package>
```
```
sudo idur remove <package>
```
```
sudo idur update
```
```
idur search <search here>
```

## Install
I've made a test installer, use it with precaution

## Create idurs
#### (simple bash knows needed)
so simple just use the create-idur. Install with
```
sudo idur install create-idur
```
And execute it on terminal
this will create a file with the start of your idur
and you have to modified the Description, Install and Remove sections.
